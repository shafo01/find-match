## Instructions

Run this game from index.html or on github through https://shafo01.github.io/find-match/

To view the documentation for the documentation go to js/out and click to view the index.html page in a browser of your choice. Jsdoc was used to generate the documentation for the javascript file.

Gulp was used to add the prefix to the css properties. The prefixes such as -web-kit are used for cross browser compatibility.

So far this app was mostly tested in chrome browser on a mac air pc.



## Acknowledgement:

To create these game I would specifically like to mention of three helpful sources:

1. A tutorial from https://3dtransforms.desandro.com/card-flip taught me how to achieve the flip card animation effect.
2. Read tutorial from w3schools about setting the timer 
3. For shuffle a code from http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976 was provided.
